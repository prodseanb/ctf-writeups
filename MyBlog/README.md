# My Blog
### Challenge:
Hi, I'm Noxtal! I have hidden a flag somewhere in my Cyberworld (AKA blog)... you may find a good application for your memory. ;)

Note: This is my real website (thus no deadly bug to exploit here). You might want to read some of my content (writeups, tutorials, and cheatsheets). I would be glad to receive any kind of feedback.

Click here to access it, have fun checking my blog out! Cheers!

Hint: replace the flag{} part with CTFlearn{}.

### Solution:
For this challenge, inspecting the site with our browser's developer tools should give us the flag. The hint seems to be Application and Memory. However, I wasted a lot of
time because the flag is hidden in the Storage tab in Firefox. Lesson learned: use multiple browsers to investigate. <br />
The flag:
```
CTFlearn{n7f_l0c4l_570r463_15n7_53cur3_570r463}
```
